# Project Title : RAG_APP_Using_Weaviate_Mistral_and_LLamaindex
## Description:
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application that combines the strengths of Weaviate, Mistral, and LLamaindex to deliver exceptional information retrieval and generation capabilities.

1. Key Components::
    1. Data: The application utilizes various data sources, potentially including plain text, PDFs, and other formats.
    2. Embedding Model:  An embedding model serves to convert text data into numerical representations suitable for efficient retrieval and similarity calculations.
    3. Data Base: Weaviate (https://www.weaviate.io/) acts as the vector database, storing the processed data and its corresponding embeddings.
    4. Prompt:Carefully crafted prompts guide Mistral, the Large Language Model (LLM), towards generating relevant and informative responses based on the retrieved data.
    5. LLM: The powerhouse of generation, Mistral (https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1) serves as the LLM responsible for generating responses
